    <h1>All about Spring</h1>

      <strong>Spring</strong><br />
      Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate seasons,
      succeeding winter and preceding summer. There are various technical
      definitions of spring, but local usage of the term varies according to
      local climate, cultures and customs. When it is spring in the Northern
      Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. At the
      spring (or vernal) equinox, days and nights are approximately twelve hours
      long, with daytime length increasing and nighttime length decreasing as
      the season progresses until the Summer Solstice in June (Northern
      Hemisphere) and December (Southern Hemisphere).

      <strong>Meteorological Reckoning</strong><br />
      Meteorologists generally define four seasons in many climatic areas:
      spring, summer, autumn (fall), and winter. These are determined by the
      values of their average temperatures on a monthly basis, with each season
      lasting three months. The three warmest months are by definition summer,
      the three coldest months are winter, and the intervening gaps are spring
      and autumn. Meteorological spring can therefore, start on different dates
      in different regions.

      <strong>Astronomical and Solar Reckoning</strong><br />
      In the Northern Hemisphere (e.g. Germany, the United States, Canada, and
      the UK),the astronomical vernal equinox (varying between 19 and 21 March)
      can be taken to mark the first day of spring with the summer solstice
      (around 21 June) marked as first day of summer. By solar reckoning, Spring
      is held to begin 1 February until the first day of Summer on May Day, with
      the summer solstice being marked as Midsummer instead of the beginning of
      Summer as with astronomical reckoning.

      <strong>Ecological Reckoning</strong><br />
      The beginning of spring is not always determined by fixed calendar dates.
      The phenological or ecological definition of spring relates to biological
      indicators, such as the blossoming of a range of plant species, the
      activities of animals, and the special smell of soil that has reached the
      temperature for micro flora to flourish. These indicators, along with the
      beginning of spring, vary according to the local climate and according to
      the specific weather of a particular year. Some ecologists divide the year
      into six seasons. In addition to spring, ecological reckoning identifies
      an earlier separate prevernal (early or pre-spring) season between the
      hibernal (winter) and vernal (spring) seasons. This is a time when only
      the hardiest flowers like the crocus are in bloom, sometimes while there
      is still some snowcover on the ground.
